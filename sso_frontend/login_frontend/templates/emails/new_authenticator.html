<p>Hi {% if first_name %}{{ first_name }}{% else %}{{ username }}{% endif %},</p>

<p>According to our records you configured a new Authenticator for your account. Details for the browser used to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Browser: {{ browser.get_readable_ua }}</li>
<li>IP address: {{Â remote_ip }} ({{ remote_ip|ip_to_geoip }})</li>
{% if browser.name %}<li>Browser name set by you: {{ browser.name }}</li>
{% endif %}
</ul>

<p><b>If you did not do this, please do the following:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>open <a href="{% full_uri 'login_frontend.views.sessions' %}">sessions</a> page, and hit "Sign out all my sessions".</li>
<li>Go to <a href="{% full_uri 'login_frontend.views.configure' %}">settings</a> and click "Reconfigure Google Authenticator" to revoke the configuration.</li>
<li>Notify IT team with as many details as you know: did you leave your session open somewhere? Did you lose your computer/mobile phone?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you configured it, there's no need for any actions. The name of the new authenticator is "{{ authenticator_id }}". All previous configurations are now revoked.
If you did this by mistake and did not scan the barcode to your phone, you can always sign in with SMS.</p>
